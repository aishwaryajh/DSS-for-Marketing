Objective: Develop a Decision Support System (DSS) to help marketers choose the most effective social media platform for advertising based on audience reach, cost per impression (CPM), conversion rates, and ad format availability.

Outcome: The system analyzes user preferences, assigns weights to key attributes, and uses Monte Carlo simulations to provide data-driven platform recommendations. Additionally, sensitivity analysis allows users to explore how changes in factors like budget or audience targeting impact the decision. This tool enables optimized marketing strategy and improved ROI.
